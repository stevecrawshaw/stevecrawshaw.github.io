## Setting up an MCP Server with Cline

This post will guide you through the process of setting up an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and integrating it with Cline.

### Introduction to MCP Servers

MCP servers extend the capabilities of AI models by providing access to external tools and resources. This allows AI to interact with real-world systems, fetch live data, and perform actions beyond their inherent knowledge.

### Install the Cline VS Code Extension
This is done like any other extension. Search for it and install.

### Specify the Model to use in Cline
As I pay for Gemini I configured Cline to use Gemini by providing my API key. This is done in the settings of Cline. You can also specify the model you want to use, I used Gemini Flash 2.5.

### MCP servers

There are a few pre - configured options available from Cline. I successfully set up Perplexity and GitHub. But have struggled to get the Motherduck Server to work. I will update this post when I have it working.
