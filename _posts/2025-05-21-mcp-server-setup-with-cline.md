## Setting up an MCP Server with Cline

This post will guide you through the process of setting up an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and integrating it with Cline.

### Introduction to MCP Servers

MCP servers extend the capabilities of AI models by providing access to external tools and resources. This allows AI to interact with real-world systems, fetch live data, and perform actions beyond their inherent knowledge.

### Steps to Setup

1.  **Define Your Server's Purpose:** What tools or resources will your MCP server provide?
2.  **Choose a Language/Framework:** Develop your server using a language and framework suitable for your needs (e.g., Node.js, Python).
3.  **Implement MCP Protocol:** Ensure your server adheres to the MCP specification for tool and resource exposure.
4.  **Integrate with Cline:** Configure Cline to recognize and utilize your new MCP server.

More details on each step will be provided in future updates.
