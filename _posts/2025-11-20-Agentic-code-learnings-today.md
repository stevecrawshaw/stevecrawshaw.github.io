- Claude OPUS burns through tokens **so fast**!
- [Factory Droid](https://factory.ai/) is just not anywhere near as good as Claude at coding (with GLM 4.6)
- Gemini 3 gave me comparable results with Claude OPUS when augmenting an XML schema (not a good test but still)
- [Meta prompting](https://github.com/glittercowboy/taches-cc-resources) looks like an interesting approach and this marketplace includes pre - built commands for implementing it. Next thing to try.
- Spent some free Claude code web credits buffing up [weca-core-data](https://github.com/stevecrawshaw/weca-core-data) ETL pipeline.
- Developing a greenhouse gas emissions and environmental dashboard for replacing the Evidence product which is being sunset. I will use meta - prompting for this. I've also augmented the xml schema using Gemini per the learning [here](https://youtu.be/6o2fN57BAUE?si=v8TzR-20nVTGOdIV)
- Microsoft CoPilot (with O365) is very poor at any code - adjacent tasks. Failed to give me the augmented XML twice and when it did, it was so generic as to be useless.
