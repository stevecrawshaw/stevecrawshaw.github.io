I signed up for the [Complete Agentic AI Engineering Course](https://edwarddonner.com/2025/04/21/the-complete-agentic-ai-engineering-course/) on Udemy. I'm going to try to follow along and write about it here.

Day 1 covers setup of the python environment and some notebook code to get going. It's nice to see the course using UV. The instructions are clear and I was able to get going quickly. I signed up for openai and anthropic API keys.
There was a useful overview of the different architectural modes of agentic AI provided in the [Anthropic paper](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents).

While I understand why the course labs use python notebooks, I do find this a bit clunky and prefer to use IPython in interactive mode.

All in all I'm pleased with day 1 progress and looking forward to the next day.
