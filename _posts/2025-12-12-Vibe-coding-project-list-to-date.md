Since buying Claude Code Pro I've tried to use it as much as possible. Projects I've completed or are in train include.

1. A [Streamlit CRUD app](https://github.com/stevecrawshaw/lnrs-db-app) to update [LNRS data](https://opendata.westofengland-ca.gov.uk/pages/lnrs-application/?headless=true) for publishing on the open data portal
2. A [Flood Warning Intensity Indicator](https://github.com/stevecrawshaw/fwii) for the West of England
3. [MCP servers](https://github.com/stevecrawshaw/rest-to-mcp-adapter) for Claude Code to access the Open Data Portal from Claude Code
4. [Analysis](https://github.com/stevecrawshaw/internal_migration) of internal migration data
5. A [documentation scraper](https://github.com/stevecrawshaw/ods-widgets-docs) for technical documents.
6. A [Streamlit dashboard](https://github.com/stevecrawshaw/ghg-emissions) of greenhouse gas emissions and EPC data

It is quite amazing what is possible with this tool.
