I work as a Senior Environment Analyst in the public sector. I'm interested in using code to solve problems and give insights. I code slowly in R, Python and SQL and some web stack. I like to explore new technologies and tools like duckDB, Polars, Quarto and all that good stuff.

This blog is intended to capture my learnings around data, analysis and technology.
