I work as an analyst in the public sector. I'm interested in using code to solve problems and give insights. I code slowly in R, Python and SQL and some web stack. I like to explore new technologies and tools like duckDB, Polars, Quarto, AI, Claude and all that good stuff.

This blog is intended to capture my learnings around data, analysis and technology. All views and posts are personal opinion.
